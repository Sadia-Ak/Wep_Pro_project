&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As SpaceX targets Wednesday afternoon for its next Starlink launch from the Space Coast, a Federal Aviation Administration operations plan advisory shows the next Polaris Dawn liftoff try will occur Friday — the same day Boeing's malfunctioning Starliner is scheduled to undock from the International Space Station for return to Earth.

First up, Wednesday's Starlink 8-11 mission has been pushed back to a 12:07 p.m. EDT target liftoff time. Only one backup opportunity remains available if needed, at 12:59 p.m., SpaceX reported.

Then Friday, an FAA launch window for Polaris Dawn opens at 3:33 a.m. and extends through 7:38 a.m. The four Polaris Dawn crew members remain in quarantine at NASA's Kennedy Space Center awaiting liftoff on their ambitious five-day orbital mission. This privately funded mission with an all-civilian crew will launch aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from KSC pad 39A — with plans to embark on the world's first commercial spacewalk outside their SpaceX Dragon capsule</p>
